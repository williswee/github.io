            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>
                I founded Tech in Asia with a mission to build and serve Asia's tech and startup community. I spend my days leading the company and staying hands-on with our content and products, always looking for new perspectives by connecting with users, founders, and colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, we've been lucky to partner with amazing folks like East Ventures, Softbank, and Y Combinator.

                Before Tech in Asia, my journey had a few interesting stops. I've taught math, sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door, and once hustled grasshoppers to my classmates for pocket money. In my twenties, I even started an education center.

                When I'm not working, I love spending time with my family 👩🏻👧🏻👧🏻👧🏻, playing tennis 🎾, reading 🧠, daydreaming 💭 and supporting startups that are making a positive impact on our environment 🟢.
